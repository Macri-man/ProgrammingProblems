Let:

𝑎
a and 
𝑏
b be positive integers

The concatenation of 
𝑎
a and 
𝑏
b, written as 
𝑎
𝑏
ab, is the number formed by putting 
𝑎
a followed by 
𝑏
b

𝑎
𝑏
=
(
𝑎
+
𝑏
)
2
ab=(a+b) 
2
 

We define:

𝑇
(
𝑛
)
T(n) = sum of all such 2025-numbers with at most 
𝑛
n digits

Examples:

2025
=
(
20
+
25
)
2
=
45
2
2025=(20+25) 
2
 =45 
2
 

3025
=
(
30
+
25
)
2
=
55
2
3025=(30+25) 
2
 =55

81
=
(
8
+
1
)
2
=
9

81=(8+1)

 =9

We are to find 
𝑇
(
16
)
T(16)
