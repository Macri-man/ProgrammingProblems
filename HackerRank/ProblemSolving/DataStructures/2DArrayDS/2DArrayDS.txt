Given a 6x6 2D array, arr, an hourglass is a subset of values with indices falling in the following pattern:

a b c  
  d  
e f g

There are 16 hourglasses in a 6x6 array. The hourglass is the sum of the values in an hourglass. Calculate the hourglass sum for every hourglass in arr, then print the maximum hourglass sum.

Example
arr =
-9 -9 -9  1 1 1 
 0 -9  0  4 3 2
-9 -9 -9  1 2 3
 0  0  8  6 6 0
 0  0  0 -2 0 0
 0  0  1  2 4 0

The 16 hourglass sums are:
-63, -34, -9, 12, 
-10,   0, 28, 23, 
-27, -11, -2, 10, 
  9,  17, 25, 18

The highest hourglass sum is 28 from the hourglass beginning at row 1, column 2:
0 4 3
  1
8 6 6

Function Description

Complete the function hourglassSum with the following parameter(s):

int arr[6][6]: a 2-D array of integers
Returns

int: the maximum hourglass sum
Input Format

Each of the 6 lines of inputs arr[i] contains 6 space-separated integers arr[i][j].

Constraints
-9<=arr[i][j]<=9
0<=i,j<=5

Sample Input
1 1 1 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 2 4 4 0
0 0 0 2 0 0
0 0 1 2 4 0

Sample Output
19

Explanation

arr contains the following hourglasses:

The hourglass with the maximum sum (19) is:
2 4 4
  2
1 2 4
