An array is a data structure that stores elements of the same type in a contiguous block of memory. In an array, A, of size N, each memory location has some unique index,  (where 0<=i<=N), that can be referenced as A[i] or Ai.

Your task is to reverse an array of integers.

Note: If you've already solved our C++ domain's Arrays Introduction challenge, you may want to skip this.

Example
A=[1,2,3]
Return [3,2,1].

Function Description

Complete the function reverseArray with the following parameter(s):

int A[n]: the array to reverse
Returns

int[n]: the reversed array
Input Format

The first line contains an integer, N, the number of integers in A.
The second line contains N space-separated integers that make up A.

Constraints
1<=N<=10^3
1<=A[i]<=10^4 where A[i] is the ith integer in A

Sample Input 1
Array: arr
1
4
3
2

4
1 4 3 2

Sample Output 1
2 3 4 1

Explanation 1
The original array is [1,4,3,2]. Reversed, it is [2,3,4,1].
